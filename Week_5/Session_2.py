# Write a function to remove all duplicate values from a sorted linked list. After removing duplicates, each element in the list should appear only once.
# Examples:
# Input: head = [1 -> 1 -> 2]
# Output: [1 -> 2]
# Input: head = [1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3]
# Output: [1 -> 2 -> 3]
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
